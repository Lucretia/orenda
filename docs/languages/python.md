# Python 3

* Seems to be based on Wirth's languages combined with functional.

e.g. From Oberon 2015:

```oberon
WHILE x > y DO x := x - y; u := u + v
ELSIF x < y DO y := y - x; v := v + u
END
```

Which Python does use. I find these constructs really weird and difficult to follow.

```python
while true:
    pass
else:
    pass
```
